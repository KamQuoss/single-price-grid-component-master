## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties generated to CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- live preview with Live Server in VSCode
- compiling from SCSS files to CSS in VSCode with LiveSassCompiler
- basics of BEM methodology
- Sass variables, mixins, special functions
- css selector specificity
- css pseudo classes

```scss
@mixin rounded-corner($position, $size) {
    border-#{$position}-radius: $size;
}
```
```scss
h1 {
    color: $cyan;
    &:first-child {margin-top: 0;}
}
```
```scss
a {
    @include button;
    width: calc(100% - #{$block-padding})
}
```
### Continued development

I want to continue learning BEM methodology, and proper naming website elements.
I found very useful Sass variables and mixins. Definitely I will use them in my future projects.
Future reading: ARIA
